A program that initialize a graph,
execute two Algorithms Random Walk and Breadth First Search.
The comparison of execution time between the C++ algorithms and LLVM compiler
depicts that an implemented loop on LLVM using syntax tree decrease the execution time compared with
the implementation of BFS C++ and RW C++.

BFS 361 microsecond(BFS .exe).
RW 360 microsecond(RW .exe).
157 microsecond(LLVM loop .exe).
